# Code of Conduct

## Philosophy

SpectreMap is built on a foundation of **technical excellence, meritocracy, and logic**. This project operates under old-school hacker ethics from the leet era: your code speaks louder than anything else. If you can contribute quality work, prove your technical skill, and operate with integrity, you're in.

**No politics. No bullshit. Just code.**

## Core Principles

### 1. Merit is King
- **Your contributions are judged by technical merit only** - clean code, innovative solutions, working exploits, documented features
- Skill level doesn't matter if you're willing to learn and improve
- Show your work. Explain your logic. Defend your implementation with evidence
- If your pull request gets rejected, it's because the code isn't up to standard - fix it and resubmit

### 2. Technical Competence Over Everything
- Know what you're talking about or shut up
- Research before you ask questions - RTFM (Read The Fucking Manual)
- Google is your friend. So is man pages. Use them
- If you claim something is broken, provide logs, stack traces, and reproduction steps
- "It doesn't work" is not a bug report

### 3. Intellectual Honesty
- Don't plagiarize code. Give credit where it's due
- If you don't know something, say so - nobody expects you to know everything
- Admit when you're wrong and learn from it
- Document your code properly - other people need to understand what you built

### 4. Hacker Ethics (Classic)
- **Access to computers should be unlimited and total** - but you better have authorization
- **All information should be free** - but stealing credentials/data isn't "liberation," it's theft
- **Mistrust authority – promote decentralization** - but follow the law where it matters
- **You can create art and beauty on a computer** - make elegant code, not bloated garbage
- **Computers can change your life for the better** - build tools that matter

## What We Expect

### Technical Standards
- Write clean, documented, maintainable code
- Follow the existing code style (use clang-format, check the style guide)
- Test your shit before you submit it
- Security vulnerabilities get fixed ASAP - no excuses
- Performance matters - don't submit code that runs like a drunk turtle

### Communication Standards
- Be direct and honest - no passive-aggressive nonsense
- Technical criticism is not personal - don't take it personally
- If someone's code sucks, explain WHY and HOW to fix it
- Argue about technical solutions, not personalities
- Keep discussions on-topic and focused on the problem

### Collaboration Standards
- Review others' code honestly - don't rubber-stamp garbage
- Respond to feedback constructively - defend your approach with logic
- Share knowledge when asked - the community grows when experts teach
- If you promise to deliver something, deliver it or say you can't

## What We Don't Tolerate

### Hard Bans (Instant Removal)
- **Using SpectreMap for unauthorized/illegal access** - we're not covering your ass in court
- **Doxxing, harassment, or stalking** - this is a technical project, not a drama club
- **Stealing code and claiming it as your own** - plagiarism is for script kiddies
- **Sharing 0-days publicly without coordinated disclosure** - don't burn the ecosystem
- **Spamming, trolling for the sake of trolling** - take it to 4chan
- **Deliberately introducing backdoors or malicious code** - you'll be reported to authorities

### Soft Bans (Warning → Kick)
- Repeatedly submitting low-quality code despite feedback
- Arguing without technical basis ("I think X is better" - cool, prove it with benchmarks)
- Not following contribution guidelines after being told multiple times
- Wasting maintainers' time with obvious questions covered in documentation

### What's NOT a Violation
- Using "offensive" language in technical discussions - we're adults, grow thicker skin
- Disagreeing strongly with design decisions - if you have a better solution, show it
- Calling out bad code - that's literally what code review is for
- Being blunt or direct - we value efficiency over hand-holding
- Memes, jokes, and hacker culture references - this is part of the tradition

## Legal & Ethical Use

### Authorized Use Requirements
This is not negotiable. **You MUST:**
- Obtain **written authorization** before using SpectreMap for any reconnaissance/pentesting
- Comply with all applicable laws (CFAA, GDPR, computer crime statutes, export controls)
- Follow responsible disclosure (90-day disclosure timeline is standard)
- Respect scope limitations - don't go rogue on engagements

### Prohibited Activities
You will be banned and potentially reported if you:
- Conduct unauthorized access to systems ("hacking" without permission)
- Use SpectreMap for criminal activities, espionage, or malicious purposes
- Steal data, exfiltrate credentials, or conduct DoS attacks without authorization
- Violate export control laws (see EXPORT_CONTROLS_COMPLIANCE.md)
- Burn researchers by releasing exploits irresponsibly

**If you get arrested for doing dumb shit with this tool, you're on your own.**

## Enforcement

### Who Enforces
Project maintainer (Lackadaisical Security) has final say on all decisions. This is not a democracy.

### How to Report Issues
- **Technical bugs**: Open a GitHub issue with full reproduction steps
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Email lackadaisicalresearch@pm.me (PGP preferred)
- **Code of conduct violations**: Email lackadaisicalresearch@pm.me with evidence
- **Illegal use**: Report to appropriate law enforcement, cc us if relevant

### Consequences
1. **First offense**: Warning via email/issue comment - fix the problem
2. **Second offense**: Temporary ban (duration depends on severity)
3. **Third offense / Severe violations**: Permanent ban from project
4. **Criminal activity**: Reported to authorities, permanent ban, legal action if applicable

### Appeals
If you think you were banned unfairly, email with a technical explanation of why. If you can't defend your position logically, the ban stands.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is **NOT** based on Contributor Covenant or any corporate DEI template.

This is based on:
- **Hacker Ethic** (Steven Levy, 1984)
- **Jargon File / Hacker's Dictionary** (Eric S. Raymond)
- **Old-school IRC/BBS culture** (pre-2010 internet)
- **Meritocratic principles** of technical communities

## Philosophy: Why This Approach?

SpectreMap is a **professional offensive security tool**, not a social club. The stakes are high:
- Users can go to prison if they misuse this tool
- Bad code can lead to operational failures in live engagements
- Security vulnerabilities can compromise entire networks
- Export control violations carry criminal penalties

**We need contributors who:**
- Take this seriously
- Can handle direct technical criticism
- Prioritize working code over feelings
- Understand the legal and ethical implications

If you're looking for a "safe space" where your code doesn't get criticized, this isn't it. If you want to build cutting-edge security tools with people who care about technical excellence, welcome aboard.

**TL;DR**: Be competent. Be honest. Don't be a criminal. Don't waste our time. Code quality matters more than your identity.
